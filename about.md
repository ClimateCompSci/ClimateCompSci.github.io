		<p>The impacts of climate change on agriculture are expected to tremendous. The approaches used to study and anticipate these impacts are driven by climate data, yet many agronomists, soil scientists, and other researchers lack the computational training to make effective use of downscaled climate projections, re-analysis datasets, or satellite remote sensing data. At the same time, climate data and remote-sensing data volumes are steadily increasing; the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), CMIP6, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2022AV000676" target="_blank">produced an estimated 20-40 petabytes of data.</a> Despite the utility and prevalence of these model outputs, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745" target="_blank">the vast majority of domain scientists who use computer-generated datasets and algorithms are self-taught.</a></p>
